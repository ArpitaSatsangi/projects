# PROJECTS
## 1. Student-management-system-project
* written in c++ using string arrays

## 2. Digital clock
* written in c 

## 3. Supermarket billing system
* written in c++ (youtube: simplilearn)

## 4. Three cup monte
* written in python(jupyter notebook)
* The game has one very simple rule. And that is to correctly guess the red ball in only one of the three boxes. The prerequisite is just not knowing clearly what is in these boxes before guessing. Thatâ€™s all.

## 5. Guessing game challenge
* written in python(jupyter notebook)
* Let's use while loops to create a guessing game.
* The Challenge:- Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:

* 1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
* 2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is
->within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
->further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
* 3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
->closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
->farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
* 4. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!

## 6. Replace value of chosen posititon game
* written in python(jupyter notebook)
* to create a small game where a user can choose a "position" in an existing list and replace it with a value of their choice.

## 7. Tic-Tac Toe Game
* written in python(jupyter notebook)
* 1. We need to print a board.
* 2. Take in player input.
* 3. Place their input on the board.
* 4. Check if the game is won,tied, lost, or ongoing.
* 5. Repeat c and d until the game has been won or tied.
* 6. Ask if players want to play again.
